Some important uses of annotations are to specify information about the: biological system in which the observation represented by the statement was made experimental methods used to demonstrate the observation knowledge source on which the statement is based, such as the citation and specific text supporting the statement Examples of annotations that could be associated with a BEL Statement are the: PubMed ID specifying the publication in which the observation was reported Species, tissue, and cellular location in which the observations were made Dosage, exposure, and recovery time associated with the observation Setting Regular Annotations \u00b6 Annotations always start with SET <keyword> where the keyword is either a standard prefix from https://identifiers.org , or a user-defined category that may encompass several namespaces. Like identifiers, annotations can look a few different ways. Old-style BEL uses prefixes that correspond to the entity type and names like: # single SET Anatomy = \"muscle\" # multiple SET Anatomy = {\"muscle\", \"brain\", \"liver\"} This type of BEL is discouraged, becuase it's neither obvious what to what namespace Anatomy refers, nor to which entities \"muscle\" and others refer. Newer BEL has two options. First, the direct prefix can be used like in # single SET go = \"0005634\" # single with OBO-style identifier SET go = \"0005634 ! nucleus\" # multiple SET go = {\"0005634\", \"0009986\"} # multiple with OBO-style identifier SET go = {\"0005634 ! nucleus\", \"0009986 ! cell surface\"} Second, the prefix can be set to a user-defined category, then full CURIEs should be used in the annotation like in: SET Compartment = \"go:0005634 ! nucleus\" SET CellLine = \"bto:0001938 ! human osteosarcoma cell line\" SET Taxonomy = \"taxonomy:9606 ! Homo sapiens\" SET ExperimentSetupSource = {\"mi:0506\", \"mi:0331\"} SET ExperimentSetupTarget = {\"mi:0331\", \"so:0001679\"} This syntax has been recommended in BEP-0013. Example - Species \u00b6 Species annotations indicate the species context for experimental observation represented by the statement. It is good practice to unambiguously assign species context to BEL Statements, even though many BEL Terms are derived from a species-specific namespace (e.g., HGNC, MGI, RGD). SET Species = \"taxonomy:9606 ! Homo sapiens.\" Other Annotation Types \u00b6 Other types of annotations can be added to statements to indicate the context of the experimental observation supported by the statement, including cell line, cell type, and cellular location. The MI2CAST recommendations do a good job of outlining what are the preferred keywords for these annotations and what namespaces are appropriate. Unsetting Annotations \u00b6 All annotations, including Citation and Evidence remain unset until the UNSET <keyword> is used. Alternatively, the special line UNSET ALL will unset all annotations. Because most BEL curation begins with a citation, many curators do not unset the annotations and assume that they are reset when a new SET Citation is encountered. In some BEL compilers, this is the default behavior (but it is configurable). Setting the Citation \u00b6 The most important annotation for each BEL statement is its citation using SET Citation = ... . Citations are a special type of annotation that references the knowledge source that reports the observation that the statement is based on. Citations are composed of a document type, and a document reference ID. For example, the citation for a journal article indexed by PubMed would be encoded as: SET Citation = {\"PubMed\", \"21533016\"} You'll notice that this acts differently than the previous annotations defined with multiple values. This represents old-style BEL. New style BEL will use CURIEs, as shown before. The equivalent new-style BEL will look like: SET Citation = \"pubmed:21533016\" This will allow for more granular citations to be used, especially when referencing online resources. Setting the Evidence \u00b6 The textual evidence is the special annotation in BEL. It is set with SET Evidence = \"<text>\"\" where the <text> comes from a research article directly. This is one of BEL's greatest strengths - most knowledge-capturing languages do not enable curators to capture this level of granularity. SET Support = \"The p53 protein activates the transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. p21 inactivates the CyclinE:Cdk2 complexes, and prevent entry of the cell into S phase, leading to G1 arrest.\" Note: the \\ character can be used to introduce line breaks for long text blocks. Please be careful with whitespace when doing this!

Representation of Experimental Data Statement Annotations Modified Proteins Reactions Protein-Protein Interactions Protein Families Representation of Experimental Data \u00b6 In a causal BEL Statement, the subject term frequently represents an experimentally manipulated entity while the object term represents a measured entity. Our best practices apply different levels of inference for mapping subject and object terms, particularly for representing 'omic data. Subject Terms (Perturbations) Relationships Object Terms (Measurements) Subject Terms (Perturbations) \u00b6 BELv2How should I represent chemical inhibitor experiments? How do I represent experiments that use site-directed mutants? How do I represent observations resulting from manipulation of two or more entities? How should I represent gene knock out or RNAi experiments? How should I represent overexpression experiments? When should I use the protein abundance vs. the activity of a protein? BELv2 How should I represent chemical inhibitor experiments? \u00b6 For experiments where protein activity is perturbed with a chemical inhibitor, we generally use the chemical as the subject term and not the activity of the target protein. In many cases, the effects of the chemical are not specific to the intended target. This representation approach avoids unintended attribution of off-target effects of a chemical to the target protein. For example, treatment of cells with the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly decreases expression of TGFB2 RNA ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20629536[PMID 20629536]): a(SCHEM:\"LY 294002\") -| r(HGNC:TGFB2) In a case where more information is available, the protein activity targeted by the inhibitor can be used as the subject term. For example, if the effect of LY 29004 on TGFB2 RNA expression was demonstrated to require the PIK3CA gene, we could represent the subject term as the kinase activity of the PIK3CA protein. act(p(HGNC:PIK3CA), ma(kin)) -> r(HGNC:TGFB2) How do I represent experiments that use site-directed mutants? \u00b6 The artificial (laboratory) creation of sequence variants is often used to investigate the effects of protein activity or specific post-translational modifications. These include proteins altered to be constitutively active or dominant negative, as well as proteins with specific amino acid residues altered to prevent phosphorylation. While many of these sequence alterations can be precisely represented with BEL, this may not be the best approach to capturing the observations from experiments that use these constructs. Non-phosphorylatable mutant \u00b6 In this example, mutation of FOXO1 serine 256 to alanine is used to block phosphorylation at 256 (S256A), a site phosphorylated by AKT. The S256A mutation was found to impair phosphorylation of threonine 24 and serine 319 by AKT ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11237865[PMID 11237865]). We could represent this observation as follows: p(HGNC:FOXO1, var(\"p.Ser256Ala\")) =| p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 256)) p(HGNC:FOXO1, var(\"p.Ser256Ala\")) =| (p(SFAM:\"AKT Family\") => p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 24))) p(HGNC:FOXO1, var(\"p.Ser256Ala\")) =| (p(SFAM:\"AKT Family\") => p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 319))) The first statement indicates that phosphorylation at S256 is blocked by mutation of S256 to alanine. The next two statements indicate that the S256A mutation decreases phosphorylation of FOXO1 threonine 24 and serine 319 by AKT. However, we are not generally interested in the effects of a lab-created mutant like S256A so much as the role of phosphorylation at serine 256 on phosphorylation of the other two sites. Thus, we recommend the following representation: p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 256)) => (p(SFAM:\"AKT Family\") => p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 24))) p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 256)) => (p(SFAM:\"AKT Family\") => p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 319))) Here, the statements indicate that phosphorylation of FOXO1 at S256 increases the phosphorylation of T24 and S319 by the kinase activity of AKT. While both representations are accurate, the second version is better suited to integrating other information about the role of FOXO1 phosphorylation at S256 into a cohesive, traversable model. How do I represent observations resulting from manipulation of two or more entities? \u00b6 In some cases an experiment has a complex perturbation, where manipulations of multiple biological entities are required for an effect. Multiple BEL abundance terms can be represented together as the subject of a BEL Statement by using the compositeAbundance() or composite() function. In this example, TGF-beta cooperates with IL-6 to generate T-helper 17 cells ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17918200[PMID 17918200]): composite(p(MGI:Tgfb1), p(MGI:Il6)) -> bp(GO:\"T-helper 17 cell differentiation\") If the two manipulated components are known to physically interact (such as a receptor and it's ligand), we recommend inferring their effects rather than using a composite term. In this example, both Met and Hgf (the Met ligand) are required for increased expression of integrin Itgav RNA ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16710476[PMID 16710476]): Not recommended: composite(p(MGI:Hgf), p(MGI:Met)) -> r(MGI:Itgav) Recommended: kin(p(MGI:Met)) -> r(MGI:Itgav) p(MGI:Hgf) -> r(MGI:Itgav) Because Hgf binds to and directly activates Met, the effect of Met and Hgf together on Itgav RNA expression can be inferred to result from Met activity. How should I represent gene knock out or RNAi experiments? \u00b6 Our general practice is to represent the subject term for experiments where the perturbation is a gene deletion or RNAi knockdown as the abundance of the corresponding protein. Gene knockouts \u00b6 In this example, mice with a gene deletion of Nfe2l2 express reduced mRNA of the glutathione S transferase Gsta1 compared to wild-type mice ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11991805[PMID 11991805]): p(MGI:Nfe2l2) -> r(MGI:Gsta1) RNA interference \u00b6 In this example, knockdown of PTEN using RNA interference results in increased CDKN1A protein levels ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17300726[PMID 17300726]): p(HGNC:PTEN) -| p(HGNC:CDKN1A) We assume that the effects of PTEN RNAi are due to knock down of PTEN protein. Decreased PTEN protein resulting in increased CDKN1A protein is interpreted as PTEN decreases CDKN1A protein. It is generally preferable to represent the subject term as the protein abundance and not an activity of the protein, particularly for 'omic experiments. See also When should I use the protein abundance vs. the activity of a protein? How should I represent overexpression experiments? \u00b6 For experiments where the perturbation is overexpression of DNA or RNA for the purpose of overexpressing a protein, we generally represent the subject term as a protein abundance. In this example, SIAH2 and repp86 (TPX2) proteins interact, and overexpression of SIAH2 by transfection increases degradation of TPX2 protein ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17716627[PMID 17716627]): p(HGNC:SIAH2) => deg(p(HGNC:TPX2)) The statement is modeled as direct because the subject and object term proteins interact. While it would be technically correct to represent overexpressions achieved via DNA transfection as gene abundances and those from mRNA transfections as RNA abundances, this distinction is not useful for applications like Whistle and pathfinding. It is generally preferable to represent the subject term as the protein abundance and not an activity of the protein, particularly for 'omic experiments, if it is not clear that the activity is required or responsible for the effect. When should I use the protein abundance vs. the activity of a protein? \u00b6 Many experimental perturbations involve the overexpression or knockdown of protein abundance. We generally represent this type of experiment using a protein abundance as the subject term instead of an activity (e.g., kinase or phosphatase) of the protein. While many proteins have a known activity, this activity is not always responsible for all downstream effects of overexpression or knockdown; the same effects occur when either wild-type or catalytically inactive forms are expressed. Below are examples of BEL statements for cases where: . the effects of increased or decreased protein abundance are not due to the catalytic activity of the protein, . effects are likely due to an increase or decrease in the activity of the protein, and . not enough information is available. Effects are not due to the catalytic activity of the protein \u00b6 Example 1. A mutant telomerase (TERT) protein lacking telomerase activity retains its effects on keratinocyte proliferation ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18208333[PMID 18208333]): p(MGI:Tert) -> bp(GO:\"cell proliferation\") act(p(MGI:Tert), ma(cat)) causesNoChange bp(GO:\"cell proliferation\") Example 2. The serine-threonine kinase RIPK1 activates NF-kappaB through a mechanism that does not involve the protein's kinase activity ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354226[PMID 20354226]). p(HGNC:RIPK1) -> act(p(GOCC:\"NF-kappaB complex\"), ma(tscript)) act(p(HGNC:RIPK1), ma(kin)) causesNoChange act(p(GOCC:\"NF-kappaB complex\"), ma(tscript)) Effects are likely due to the activity of the protein \u00b6 Example. Genes are differentially expressed in wild-type vs. Met knock out mouse hepatocytes, only after treatment with Hgf, the Met ligand ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16710476[PMID 16710476]). These genes include integrins Itgav, Itga3, and Itgb1. act(p(MGI:Met), ma(kin)) -> r(MGI:Itgav) act(p(MGI:Met), ma(kin)) -> r(MGI:Itga3) act(p(MGI:Met), ma(kin)) -> r(MGI:Itgb1) Because both Met and the Met ligand are required for the increase in gene expression, we use the activity of Met as the subject term. Not enough information is available \u00b6 Example. Genes are differentially expressed in the pancreas of mice with a pancreas-specific beta-catenin deletion ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17222338[PMID 17222338]). These include decreased expression of the hedgehog interacting protein Hhip in the knock-out compared to wild-type. p(MGI:Ctnnb1) -> r(MGI:Hhip) In this case, not enough information is available to determine if the change in Hhip expression is due to Ctnnb1 function in transcription, cell adhesion, or another role. Relationships \u00b6 When should I use a correlative relationship? \u00b6 Correlative Relationships, Correlative relationships are more appropriate than Causal Relationships, causal relationships to represent observations that do not clearly result from an experimental perturbation. BEL causal relationships include increases , decreases , directlyIncreases , directlyDecreases , and regulates . Correlative relationships include positiveCorrelation and negativeCorrelation . Correlative \u00b6 If the observation comes from the comparison of human tumors grouped by the occurrence of a specific mutation, then the relationship should generally be expressed as correlative. In this case there is no experimental perturbation. In this example, most patient tumor samples with an EGFR L858R mutation were observed to exhibit a reduction in ERBB2 tyrosine 1248 phosphorylation compared to wild-type samples ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18687633[PMID 18687633]): p(HGNC:EGFR, var(\"p.Leu858Arg\")) negativeCorrelation p(HGNC:ERBB2, pmod(Ph,Tyr,1248)) In this case, no evidence is presented to suggest that the differences in ERBB2 phosphorylation are causally related to the EGFR mutation, only that the two observations are inversely correlated. Note that the subject and object terms are interchangeable for correlative relationships. Causal \u00b6 If the observation comes from the comparison of experimentally controlled states, like gene deletion, overexpression, or introduction of a mutant allele into a cell line or animal, the experimental perturbation can generally be represented as the subject term of a causal statement. In this example, DUSP6 RNA is observed to be upregulated in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells transfected with EGFR mutant L858R, as compared to WT EGFR ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16489012[PMID 16489012]): p(HGNC:EGFR, var(\"p.Leu858Arg\")) -> r(HGNC:DUSP6) In this case, the EGFR mutation is introduced as an experimentally-controlled perturbation. Object Terms (Measurements) \u00b6 How should I represent microarray data? \u00b6 We record the results of experiments like microarrays and RT-PCR, which measure RNA abundances, by representing the object terms as RNA abundances. Only significant effects (e.g., meeting minimum criteria for fold change and statistical significance) should be recorded in BEL Statements. In a causal BEL Statement, the subject term generally represents an experimentally manipulated entity while the object term represents a measured entity. Our general practice is to represent the object terms in BEL Statements with the terms most closely related to the experimental measurement. This direct representation of the measurement in BEL supports the creation of KAMs to which 'omic data can be mapped directly and analyzed using automated reasoning applications like Whistle. Inference of the potential downstream consequences of RNA expression changes is supported by connection of RNA abundances to the corresponding proteins during knowledge network compilation Statement Annotations \u00b6 How do I annotate a relationship observed in multiple biological contexts? \u00b6 Often, the scientific literature reports a relationship as occurring across several biological contexts. Our general practice is to represent each observation with a separate statement. Several annotations can be used to describe the same context, e.g., 'lung' and 'fibroblast', but distinct BEL statements should be used to describe each experimental context that the relationship is observed in. Example \u00b6 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18650932[PMID 18650932] - siRNA knockdown of the atypical PKC-interacting protein Par-4 (PAWR) increases phosphorlyation of AKT at Serine 473 in both human 293 and A549 cells. \"To test whether this is also true in human cells, we used a Par-4 siRNA to deplete endogenous Par-4 levels in human 293 cells and in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. Cells were treated with control or Par-4-specific siRNAs, after which they were kept for 24 h in serum-free medium conditions and then stimulated with serum. Data in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2519103/figure/f5/[Figure 5E and F] clearly demonstrate that the knockdown of Par-4 provokes enhanced serum-activated phospho-Akt-Ser473 levels in A549 and 293 human cells, respectively.\" Not recommended: SET CellLine = {A549, 293} p(HGNC:PAWR) -| p(SFAM:\"AKT Family\", pmod(Ph, Ser, 473)) Recommended: SET CellLine = A549 p(HGNC:PAWR) -| p(SFAM:\"AKT Family\", pmod(Ph, Ser, 473)) SET CellLine p(HGNC:PAWR) -| p(SFAM:\"AKT Family\", pmod(Ph, Ser, 473)) Modified Proteins \u00b6 How do I represent a protein modification when specific information is not available? How do I represent a protein modification within a complex? Xmultphosphforprotein, How do I represent a situation where multiple phosphorylations are required for a protein's activity? How do I represent a situation where one protein modification initiates additional modifications? Xremovalofproteinmod, How do I represent removal of a protein modification (e.g., dephosphorylation, deubiquitination)? How do I represent a protein modification when specific information is not available? \u00b6 BEL terms for Protein Modifications, post-translational modifications of proteins specify the type of modification, the modified amino acid, and the position of the modified amino acid. The modified amino acid and position are not required, so protein modifications can be represented with less specific information. Example \u00b6 Human AKT1 protein modified by phosphorylation at serine 473 p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 473)) Human AKT1 protein modified by phosphorylation at an unspecified serine residue p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(Ph, Ser)) Human AKT1 protein that has been modified by phosphorylation at an unspecified amino acid residue p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(Ph)) As a general rule, if specific information is available, it should be used. In some cases, this involves investigation sections of a paper outside of the evidence text or other referenced papers to determine which specific modifications have been measured. Non-specific protein modification terms have limited value in the context of a knowledge network. For example, phosphorylation at different sites of the same protein can have opposing effects. For example: \"Akt-phosphorylated FOXO interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Skp2 and is targeted for proteasomal degradation\" ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15917664[PMID 15917664]) Example \u00b6 Recommended: act(p(SFAM:\"AKT Family\"), ma(kin)) => (act(p(HGNC:SKP2)) => deg(p(SFAM:\"FOXO Family\"))) Not recommended: p(SFAM:\"FOXO Family\", pmod(Ph)) => (act(p(HGNC:SKP2)) => deg(p(SFAM:\"FOXO Family\"))) The first BEL Statement indicates that the kinase activity of AKT increases the degradation of FOXO by SKP2. The second statement indicates that phosphorylation of FOXO increases the degradation of FOXO by SKP2. In this case, more information is captured by using the phosphorylating kinase AKT as the subject term instead of the non-specified phosphorylation of FOXO. How do I represent a protein modification within a complex? \u00b6 In many cases, complexes include proteins with post-translational modifications and these modifications influence complex formation. For example, HIF1A that has been hydroxylated on proline residues 402 and 564 interacts with VHL ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17925579[PMID 17925579]). Our general practice is to represent this type of event as a causal statement in BEL, with the modified protein as the subject term and the complex with no specified modifications as the object term. Because the modified protein is a component of the complex, we use a direct causal relationship: p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 402)) => complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A), p(HGNC:VHL)) p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 564)) => complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A), p(HGNC:VHL)) While BEL allows representation of complexes with the modified proteins as components, we do not recommend this approach: complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 402)), p(HGNC:VHL)) The practice of composing a complex using protein abundances without any specified modifications provides a standardized representation for complexes and allows the effects of modifications on complex formation to be captured as causal relationships. The modified forms of HIF1A, p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 402)) and p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 564)) are considered a subset of the total p(HGNC:HIF1A) . This approach enables representation of the effects of multiple protein modifications on complex formation by using a causal statement for each modification. BELv2.0 does not provide a specific representation of unmodified protein abundances. Exception \u2013 modified histones bound to the promoter of a specific gene \u00b6 One exception to our general practice of not specifying protein modifications within complex abundances is the interaction of specific modified histones with the promoter of a specific gene. In this example, cigarette smoke is observed to increase H3K27me3 levels at the DKK1 promoter ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19351856[PMID 19351856]). a(SCHEM:\"smoke condensate, cigarette (gas phase)\") -> \\ complex(p(PFH:\"Histone H3 Family\",pmod(Me3, Lys, 27)), g(HGNC:DKK1)) In this example, the modification of the histone by trimethylation does not affect its binding to the gene DKK1. In addition, cigarette smoke does not increase or decrease the overall abundance of the modified histone, only the abundance of the modified histone at the DKK1 promoter. How do I represent a situation where multiple phosphorylations are required for a protein's activity? \u00b6 In many cases two or more distinct modifications are required simultaneously for protein activity, and neither modification alone is sufficient. For example, MAPK3 must be phosphorylated at two sites, Threonine 202 and Tyrosine 204, to be active. Our general practice is to take the simple, most general approach, and model the effect of each site separately: p(HGNC:MAPK3, pmod(Ph, Thr, 202)) => act(p(HGNC:MAPK3), ma(kin)) p(HGNC:MAPK3, pmod(Ph, Tyr, 204)) => act(p(HGNC:MAPK3), ma(kin)) A multiply-modified abundance term can be used if it is of high importance to capture the requirement for both modifications: p(HGNC:MAPK3, pmod(Ph, Thr, 202)), pmod(Ph, Tyr, 204)) => act(p(HGNC:MAPK3), ma(kin)) How do I represent a situation where one protein modification initiates additional modifications? \u00b6 In many cases a specific protein modification may be dependent on another modification of the same protein. In this case, the first protein modification can be modeled as the upstream cause of the second. In this example, phosphorylation of CTNNB1 at Serine 45 initiates phosphorylation of CTNNB1 at other sites including Threonine 41 by GSK3 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16618120[PMID 16618120]): p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 45)) => p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 41)) We represent this relationship as direct, because the subject and object terms have the same root abundance node. Because the kinase mediating the second phosphorylation is known, this relationship can be modeled alternatively as a nested statement: p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 45)) => \\ (kin(p(SFAM:\"GSK3 Family\")) => p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 41))) How do I represent removal of a protein modification (e.g., dephosphorylation, deubiquitination)? \u00b6 Removal of a specific protein modification is represented simply as a decrease in the abundance of the modified protein. Deubiquitination \u00b6 In this example, STAMBP deubiquitinates F2RL1 protein ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19684015[PMID 19684015]): act(p(HGNC:STAMBP)) =| p(HGNC:F2RL1, pmod(Ub)) Deubiquitination is represented simply as a decrease in the ubiquitinated form of the protein. Because in this example STAMBP is the deubiquitinating enzyme, we used a directlyDecreases relationship. Dephosphorylation \u00b6 In this example, the phosphatase CDC25C dephosphorylates CDK1 at tyrosine 15 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=1384126[PMID 1384126]): act(p(HGNC:CDC25C), ma(phos)) =| p(HGNC:CDK1, pmod(Ph, Tyr, 15)) Similar to deubiquitination, dephosphorylation is represented simply as a decrease in the modified form of the protein. Reactions \u00b6 How can I represent a reversible metabolic reaction? When and why should I use a reaction term? How can I represent a reversible metabolic reaction? \u00b6 A reversible reaction can be represented by modeling the reaction with the products and reactants interchanged. For example, HSD11B1 acts primarily to convert cortisone to active cortisol, but in some cell types the reverse reaction is favored ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=12530648[PMID 12530648]): act(p(HGNC:HSD11B1), ma(cat)) => \\ rxn(reactants(a(CHEBI:NADPH), a(CHEBI:cortisone)), products(a(CHEBI:\"NADP(+)\"), a(CHEBI:cortisol))) act(p(HGNC:HSD11B1), ma(cat)) => \\ rxn(reactants(a(CHEBI:\"NADP(+)\"), a(CHEBI:cortisol)), products(a(CHEBI:NADPH), a(CHEBI:cortisone))) The top statement represents the forward reaction and the bottom statement represents the reverse reaction. When and why should I use a reaction term? \u00b6 When_ should I use a reaction term \u00b6 Reaction terms allow the representation of a transformation of a list of reactants into a list of products. In this example, the superoxide dismutase SOD1 converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide: act(p(HGNC:SOD1), ma(cat)) => rxn(reactants(a(CHEBI:superoxide)), products(a(CHEBI:\"hydrogen peroxide\"))) It is not necessary to include all reactants and products, especially if they are ubiquitous small molecules. In the above example the reactant hydrogen and product oxygen have been omitted from the reaction. Why_ should I use a reaction term \u00b6 It is possible to represent the above reaction with separate statements linking the activity of SOD1 to decreased abundances of the reactants and increased abundances of the products: act(p(HGNC:SOD1), ma(cat)) =| a(CHEBI:superoxide) act(p(HGNC:SOD1), ma(cat)) => a(CHEBI:\"hydrogen peroxide\") While this representation describes the function of the catalytic enzyme SOD1, it does not link the product hydrogen peroxide to the reactant superoxide. Protein-Protein Interactions \u00b6 How do I represent a physical interaction between two entities? \u00b6 You can use a complex abundance to represent binding events between two or more abundance terms. The subject term of your BEL Statement will be the complex. BEL Statements do not require a relationship and object term. The order in which the members of the complex are listed is not important. Examples \u00b6 EPOR physically interacts with CSF2RB, the common beta-receptor ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15456912[PMID 15456912]) complex(p(MGI:EPOR), p(MGI:CSF2RB)) KEAP1 binds 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15917255[PMID 15917255]) complex(p(HGNC:KEAP1), a(CHEBI:\"15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2\")) KEAP1, CUL3, and RBX1 copurify and are part of a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15572695[PMID 15572695]) complex(p(HGNC:KEAP1), p(HGNC:RBX1), p(HGNC:CUL3)) The AP-1 transcription complex binds the CCL23 promoter ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17368823[PMID 17368823]) complex(p(GOCC:\"AP1 complex\"), g(HGNC:CCL23)) Protein Families \u00b6 When should I use a protein family instead of a specific protein? \u00b6 Protein families can be used to represent protein abundances in cases where the information presented by the source does not allow identification of the specific protein. For example: Example 1: \u00b6 SET Citation = \"pubmed:11715018\" SET Evidence = \"Akt physically associates with MDM2 and phosphorylates it at Ser166 and Ser186.\" act(p(fplx:AKT), ma(kin)) => p(HGNC:MDM2, pmod(Ph,Ser,166)) act(p(fplx:AKT), ma(kin)) => p(HGNC:MDM2, pmod(Ph,Ser,186)) Here, Akt may refer to AKT1, AKT2, and/or AKT3. Example 2: \u00b6 SET Citation = \"pubmed:17003045\" SET Evidence = \"We show that Siah2 is subject to phosphorylation by p38 MAPK ... Phosphopeptide mapping identified T24 and S29 as the primary phospho-acceptor sites.\" act(p(PFH:\"MAPK p38 Family\"), ma(kin)) => p(HGNC:SIAH2, pmod(Ph, Thr, 24)) act(p(PFH:\"MAPK p38 Family\"), ma(kin)) => p(HGNC:SIAH2, pmod(Ph, Ser, 29)) Here, it is not clear which specific p38 MAPK is responsible (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13, or MAPK14). Example 3: \u00b6 \"Hip encodes a membrane glycoprotein that binds to all three mammalian Hedgehog proteins.\" ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=10050855[PMID 10050855]) complex(p(SFAM:\"Hedgehog Family\"), p(MGI:Hhip)) complex(p(MGI:Ihh), p(MGI:Hhip)) complex(p(MGI:Shh), p(MGI:Hhip)) complex(p(MGI:Dhh), p(MGI:Hhip)) In this case, all three hedgehog family members are reported to bind to the hedgehog interacting protein (Hhip). Statements can be modeled using the family as well as each individual member. More Cookbook \u00b6 Causal Statement Examples \u00b6 Causal statements connect subject and object terms with a causal <<Xincreases, increases>> , <<Xdecreases, decreases>> , or <<Xcnc, causesNoChange>> relationship. Subject terms can be an abundance or process (including activities and transformations) and object terms can be either an abundance, a process, or a second BEL Statement. <> <> <> Causal increase \u00b6 Example \u00b6 These statements use the causal <<Xincreases, increases>> relationship. These statements are annotated with a citation and supporting evidence text, as well as with the cell line and species context for the experimental observations represented by the statements. These two statements represent the observation that increases in IL6 protein abundance cause increases in the RNA abundance of ENO1 and XBP1.

Because all BEL terms denote classes, membership in a group is an important special case where subsets of a class that define the class are designated. [TIP] The BEL Framework adds family members to protein families and complex components to named complexes during network compilation. <> <> Protein Family \u00b6 In this example, members of a protein family are assigned using the <<hasMember>> and <<hasMembers>> relationships. The hasMembers relationship is used to assign a list of protein abundances as members of a protein family. This relationship is a syntactic convenience that is equivalent to the set of two statements using the hasMember relationship. These statements designate the protein abundances of MAPK8 and MAPK9 as members of the JNK MAPK protein family. The term representing the JNK family is a protein abundance based on the name MAPK JNK Family in the Selventa Protein Families namespace. p(SFAM:\"MAPK JNK Family\") hasMembers list(p(HGNC:MAPK8), p(HGNC:MAPK9)) The hasMember relationship is used to assign individual protein abundances to a protein family. p(SFAM:\"MAPK JNK Family\") hasMember p(HGNC:MAPK8) p(SFAM:\"MAPK JNK Family\") hasMember p(HGNC:MAPK9) Complex Component \u00b6 In this example components are assigned to a named protein complex using the <> and <> relationships. The hasComponents relationship is similar to the hasMembers relationship and is used to assign a list of abundances as components of a complex.These statements designate the protein abundances of RAD9A, RAD1, and HUS1 as components of the complex abundance of the checkpoint clamp complex . complex(GOCC:\"checkpoint clamp complex\") hasComponents list(p(HGNC:RAD9A), p(HGNC:RAD1), p(HGNC:HUS1)) The hasComponent relationship is used to assign individual abundances to a named protein complex. complex(GOCC:\"checkpoint clamp complex\") hasComponent p(HGNC:RAD9A) complex(GOCC:\"checkpoint clamp complex\") hasComponent p(HGNC:RAD1) complex(GOCC:\"checkpoint clamp complex\") hasComponent p(HGNC:HUS1) The single hasComponents statement is equivalent to the set of three hasComponent statements. Example - Binding Interaction \u00b6 The complexAbundance() function can be used to specify molecular interactions between abundances. This function can take either a list of abundances that define a molecular complex or a namespace value that represents a molecular complex (e.g., many GO Cellular Component values) as an argument. These examples demonstrate the use of the complexAbundance() function to represent protein-protein, protein-chemical, and protein-DNA interactions.

The activity() function provides distinct terms that enable differentiation of the increase or decrease of the molecular activity of a protein from changes in the abundance of the protein. activity() can be applied to a protein, complex, or RNA abundance term, and modified with a `molecularActivity() argument to indicate a specific type of molecular activity. # long form activity(p(hgnc:391 ! :AKT1)) # short form act(p(hgnc:391 ! :AKT1)) To more specifically talk about what kind of activity a physical entity has, you can use the molecularActivity() or ma() .

The activity() function is sufficient for distinguishing the frequency of events mediated by an abundance from the amount of the abundance. This term represents the ligand-bound activity of the human non-catalytic receptor protein TLR7. # long form activity(proteinAbundance(HGNC:TLR7)) # short form act(p(HGNC:TLR7)) Catalytic Activity A protein, complex, or ribozymes has catalytic activity when it acts as an enzymatic catalyst of biochemical reactions. Catalytic activity includes kinase, phosphatase, peptidase, and ADP-ribosylase activities, though these can be represented by more specific molecular activity terms. This term represents the frequency of events in which the protein abundance of rat Sod1 acts as a catalyst. # Using BEL default namespace act(p(RGD:Sod1), ma(cat)) # Using Gene Ontology act(p(RGD:Sod1), ma(GO:\"catalytic activity\")) Peptidase Activity This term represents the frequency of events in which the protein abundance of mouse Casp3 acts as a peptidase.The more specific GO Molecular Function term \"cysteine-type endopeptidase activity\" is also applicable. # Using BEL default namespace act(p(MGI:Casp3), ma(pep)) # Using Gene Ontology act(p(MGI:Casp3), ma(GO:\"peptidase activity\")) G-proteins in the active (GTP-bound) state The activity of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) like RAS in the active, GTP-bound state. This term represents the frequency of events caused by the active, GTP-bound form of the RAS protein family. # Using BEL default namespace act(p(SFAM:\"RAS Family\"), ma(gtp)) # Using Gene Ontology act(p(SFAM:\"RAS Family\"), ma(GO:\"GTP binding\")) Transporter Activity Molecular translocation events mediated by transporter proteins like ion channels or glucose transporters. This term represents the frequency of ion transport events mediated by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) complex. # Using BEL default namespace act(complex(NCH:\"ENaC Complex\"), ma(tport)) # Using Gene Ontology act(complex(NCH:\"ENaC Complex\"), ma(GO:\"transporter activity\")) Chaperone Activity This term represents the events in which the human Calnexin protein functions as a chaperone to aid the folding of other proteins. # Using BEL default namespace act(p(HGNC:CANX), ma(chap)) # Using Gene Ontology Transcription Activity Events in which a protein or molecular complex acts to directly control transcription, including proteins acting directly as transcription factors, as well as transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors. This term represents the frequency of events in which the mouse p53 protein controls RNA expression. # Using BEL default namespace act(p(MGI:Trp53), ma(tscript)) # Using Gene Ontology act(p(MGI:Trp53), ma(GO:\"nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity\")) Transformation Functions \u00b6 The following BEL functions represent parametrized biological processes. Currently, BEL parametrizes translocation and degradation processes. Translocations \u00b6 A translocation(<abundance>, fromLocation(ns1:v1), toLocation(ns2:v2)) or tloc(<abundance>, fromLoc(ns1:v1), toLoc(ns2:v2)) denotes the process in which a physical entity is moved from one location to another. For example, endocytosis (translocation from the cell surface to the endosome) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein can be represented as: # Long form translocation(p(hgnc:3236 ! EGFR), fromLocation(go:0009986 ! \"cell surface\"), toLocaction(go:0005768 ! endosome)) # Short form tloc(p(hgnc:3236 ! EGFR), fromLoc(go:0009986 ! \"cell surface\"), toLoc(go:0005768 ! endosome)) In general, the fromLoc() and toLoc() functions take in an identifier: toLoc(prefix:identifier [! name]) fromLoc(prefix:identifier [! name]) The most reasonable namespaces to use for locations are from the GO cellular components branch and maybe cell types. MeSH also contains locations, but are not recommended because of lack of mappings. Cell Secretion \u00b6 This term represents the event in which human NFE2L2 protein is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. # long form translocation(p(HGNC:NFE2L2), fromLoc(mesh:D003593 ! Cytoplasm), toLoc(mesh:D002467 ! \"Cell Nucleus\")) # short form tloc(p(HGNC:NFE2L2), fromLoc(mesh:D003593 ! Cytoplasm), toLoc(mesh:D002467 ! \"Cell Nucleus\")) There are also two convenience functions, cellSurfaceExpression() and cellSecretion() , that are so common that they are part of BEL with pre-defined toLoc() and fromLoc() . For example, the following represents secretion of mouse IL6 protein. # long form cellSecretion(p(mgi:96559 ! Il6)) # short form sec(p(mgi:96559 ! Il6)) Cell Surface Expression \u00b6 cellSurfaceExpression(<abundance>) or surf(<abundance>) denotes the frequency or abundance of events in which members of <abundance> move to the surface of cells. cellSurfaceExpression(<abundance>) can be equivalently expressed as: tloc(<abundance>, fromLoc(go:intracellular), toLoc(go:\"cell surface\")) The intent of the cellSurfaceExpression() function is to provide a simple, standard means of expressing a commonly represented translocation. For the abundance term A, cellSecretion(<abundance>) or sec(<abundance>) denotes the frequency or number of events in which members of <abundance> move from cells to regions outside of the cells. cellSecretion(<abundance> can be equivalently expressed as: tloc(<abundance>, fromLoc(go:intracellular), toLoc(go:\"extracellular space\")) The intent of the cellSecretion() function is to provide a simple, standard means of expressing a commonly represented translocation. This term represents cell surface expression of rat Fas protein. # long form cellSurfaceExpression(p(rgd:619831 ! Fas)) # short form surf(p(rgd:619831 ! Fas)) Degradation \u00b6 Events in which an abundance is degraded can be represented by the degradation() or deg() function. degradation(<abundance>) or deg(<abundance>) denotes the frequency or number of events in which a member of <abundance> is degraded in some way such that it is no longer a member of <abundance> . For example, degradation() is used to represent proteasome-mediated proteolysis. If can be inferred that: deg(X) directlyDecreases X This term represents the degradation of MYC RNA. Degradation decreases the amount of the abundance - when degradation statements are compiled, a directlyDecreases relationship edge is added between the degradation term and the degraded entity. # long form degradation(rnaAbundance(hgnc:7553 ! MYC)) # short form deg(r(hgnc:7553 ! MYC)) Note the degradation relationship is not recommended, because it's more direct to just use the decreases relationship to show that the abundance is lowered. Cellular Location \u00b6 Unlike the translocation process, each node can be annotated with the location where it is inside the cell with the location() / loc() function. It can be used as an argument within any abundance function except compositeAbundance() to represent a distinct subset of the abundance at that location. Location subsets of abundances have the general form: f(ns:v, loc(ns:v)) The location should come following all modifications and variants. For example, the AKT protein in the cytoplasm can be encoded in BEL as: # long form p(hgnc:391 ! AKT1, location(mesh:D003593 ! Cytoplasm)) # short form p(hgnc:391 ! AKT1, loc(mesh:D003593 ! Cytoplasm)) While this information is written in the BEL term that is in either the subject or object, the fact that the entity is in a given location is actually metadata that is stored at the statement leve. Example - Endoplasmic Reticulum pool of Ca^2+^ \u00b6 a(chebi:29108 ! \"calcium(2+)\", loc(go:0005783 ! \"endoplasmic reticulum\")) Nested Statements \u00b6 While most BEL statements take the form of <subject> <predicate> <object> where the subject and object may have some of the preceding modifiers attached, it is also possible to use an entire BEL statement as the object. This makes BEL a recursively defined language Nested statements should only be curated when there is clear transitivity between the two statements and the relationships are casual. For example, GATA1 directly increases the process in which the activity of the ZBTB16 protein directly increases the abundance of RNA designated by MPL . This can be encoded in BEL as: p(hgnc:4170 ! GATA1) => ( act(p(hgnc:12930 ! ZBTB16)) => r(hgnc:7217 ! MPL) ) If you are working in a network context, nested statements in the form of A P1 (B P2 C) can be decomposed into A P1 B B P2 C A P1 * P2 C Where P1 and P2 are predicates, and their product P1 * P2 is increases if both are increases or both are decreases. Their product P1 * P2 is decreases if one is decreases and the other is increases. Another example: the CLSPN protein is considered to directly activate the phosphorylation of CHEK1 protein by the kinase activity of ATR, because the CLSPN and ATR proteins physically interact. p(hgnc:19715 ! CLSPN) => (act(p(hgnc:882 ! ATR), ma(kin)) => p(hgnc:1925 ! CHEK1, pmod(Ph)))","title":"Statements"},{"location":"statements/#entity-modifiers","text":"While BEL terms and relations are the building bocks for BEL statements, there are a few things that can be added to make them much more rich.","title":"Entity Modifiers"},{"location":"statements/#edge-modifiers","text":"","title":"Edge Modifiers"},{"location":"statements/#molecular-activity","text":"You might have noticed functions for representing chemicals, genes, RNAs, proteins, and all have the suffix abundance .

The activity() function provides distinct terms that enable differentiation of the increase or decrease of the molecular activity of a protein from changes in the abundance of the protein. activity() can be applied to a protein, complex, or RNA abundance term, and modified with a `molecularActivity() argument to indicate a specific type of molecular activity. # long form activity(p(hgnc:391 ! :AKT1)) # short form act(p(hgnc:391 ! :AKT1)) To more specifically talk about what kind of activity a physical entity has, you can use the molecularActivity() or ma() .

Biological experiments frequently involve the manipulation and measurement of entities in samples. These BEL functions specify the type of entity referred to by a namespace value. For example, geneAbundance(hgnc:391 ! AKT1) , rnaAbundance(hgnc:391 ! AKT1) , and proteinAbundance(hgnc:391 ! AKT1) , represent the abundances of the AKT1 gene, RNA, and protein, respectively. Genes \u00b6 The protein-coding gene TMTC1 can be encoded in BEL like: # long form geneAbundance(hgnc:24099 ! TMTC1) # short form g(hgnc:24099 ! TMTC1) In general, any gene can be encoded using the form: g(prefix:identifier [! name]) You can encode the genomic relationship between a gene and the RNA(s) to which it is is transcribed like: g(hgnc:24099 ! TMTC1) transcribedTo r(ensembl:ENST00000539277.6 ! TMTC1-203) g(hgnc:24099 ! TMTC1) transcribedTo r(ensembl:ENST00000256062.9 ! TMTC1-201) g(hgnc:24099 !

TMTC1) transcribedTo r(ensembl:ENST00000553189.5 ! TMTC1-209) You can also encode the binding event between a gene and its transcription factor(s) like: complex(g(hgnc:24099 ! TMTC1), p(hgnc:3819 ! FOXO1)) More information about complexes can be found below . Recommended Nomenclatures \u00b6 The following nomenclatures are recommended for genes: prefix name species ncbigene NCBI Entrez Gene all hgnc HGNC human fb FlyBase drosophila melanogaster mgi Mouse Genome Informatics mouse rgd Rat Genome Database rat sgd Saccharomyces Genome Database Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) pombase PomBase Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast) wormbase WormBase C elegans (nematode) xenbase Xenbase xenopus (frogs) zfin Zebrafish Information Network zebrafish dbsnp dbSNP human Some nomenclatures are species-specific (e.g. HGNC covers human genes), and some cover many species (e.g. NCBI Entrez Gene xocrse many. The orthology between two genes from different species can be written like: g(hgnc:14064 ! HDAC6) orthologousTo g(mgi:1333752 ! Hdac6) Genetic Variants \u00b6 Variants like substitutions, deletions, insertions, and anything that can be represented with the HGVS nomenclature can be added to a gene following the identifier using the variant() / var() function. For example, the protein-coding gene CFTR (hgnc:1884) when missing phenylalanine 508 ( \u0394F508 ) misfolds and leads to cystic fibrosis. This genetic variant can be written in BEL as: # long form g(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, variant(\"c.1521_1523delCTT\")) # short form g(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"c.1521_1523delCTT\")) In general, any variant can be encoded like: var(\"HGVS string\") This variant has been listed by the dbSNP database as rs113993960 . It can be directly encoded in BEL as: g(dbsnp:rs113993960) The equivalence between these two BEL terms is different than simple identifier equivalence, so it can be encoded with the equivalentTo / eq relationship like: g(dbsnp:rs113993960) eq g(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"c.1521_1523delCTT\")) Because a specific position is referenced, a namespace value for a non-ambiguous sequence like the RefSeq ID in the lower example is preferred over the HGNC gene symbol (when possible). The c. within the HGVS string indicates that the numbering is based on a coding DNA reference sequence. The coding DNA reference sequence covers the part of the transcript that is translated into protein; numbering starts at the A of the initiating ATG codon, and ends at the last nucleotide of the translation stop codon. The CFTR gene can be written with a RefSeq identifier as: g(refseq:\"NM_000492.3\", var(\"c.1521_1523delCTT\")) Example - substitution Example - double substitution g(hgnc:2928 ! DMD, var(\"c.[145C>T;147C>G]\") Example - insertion TODO Genetic Modifications \u00b6 Modifications to the physical genomic sequence can be represented in BEL using the geneModification() / gmod() function following the identifier in a g() function. For example, the methylation of the NDUFB6 gene causes a decline in its expression in muscles (pubmed:17948130). This can be represented with: # long form g(hgnc:7701 ! NDUFB6, geneModification(Methylation)) # short form g(hgnc:7701 ! NDUFB6, gmod(Me)) In general, the geneModification() / gmod() function takes the following form: gmod(prefix:identifier [! name]) However, there are several built-in gene modifications in BEL that can be referenced without a CURIE from the following table: Short Long Me Methylation ADPRib ADP-ribosylation These can be written as: # long form gmod(Methylation) gmod(ADP-ribosylation) # short form gmod(Me) gmod(ADPRib) While protein modifications have high quality sources like PSI-MOD, genenetic/genomic modifications do not. One source that may grow over time is the DNA modification (go:0006304) branch in the GO biological process namespace. Even though the semantics are not exactly correct, this still may prove a useful source for gene modification nomenclature. The previous example can be written with DNA methylation (go:0006306) instead of the BEL default name Me like: g(hgnc:7701 ! NDUFB6, gmod(go:0006306 ! \"DNA methylation\")) RNAs \u00b6 The long non-coding RNA Homo sapiens MAPT antisense RNA 1 (MAPT-AS1) can be encoded in BEL with: # long form rnaAbundance(rnacentral:URS000075DB76 ! MAPT-AS1) # short form r(rnacentral:URS000075DB76 ! MAPT-AS1) In general, any RNA type can be encoded using the form, with the exception of miRNAs , which have their own function: r(prefix:identifier [! name]) Like in the previous example, it can be shown from which gene an RNA is transcribed like: g(hgnc:43738 ! ) transcribedTo r(rnacentral:URS000075DB76 ! MAPT-AS1) It can also be shown that an RNA is translated to a protein like: g(hgnc:6893 ! MAPT) transcribedTo r(ensembl:ENST00000344290.9 ! MAPT-204) r(ensembl:ENST00000344290.9 ! MAPT-204) translatedTo p(uniprot:P10636 ! TAU_HUMAN) There are situations when the exact transcript for a given gene is not known, in which case it is common to refer to the RNA transcript using the gene's identifier like: g(hgnc:6893 ! MAPT) transcribedTo r(hgnc:6893 ! MAPT) A functional RNA might appear in a relationship in which it causes the regulation of a gene's expression ref : r(rnacentral:URS000075DB76 ! MAPT-AS1) decreases r(hgnc:6893 ! MAPT) RNA Variants \u00b6 Like genes, RNAs can be described with variants using the var() function. Looking back at the CFTR gene that causes \u0394F508 , the RNA variant would look like: r(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"r.1653_1655delcuu\")) The RefSeq identifier could be used to more explicitly state the sequence to which the HGVS string is referring. r(refseq:\"NM_000492.3\", var(\"r.1653_1655delcuu\")) The coding gene and protein from this variant could be connected with the following transcribedTo and translatedTo relations: g(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"c.1521_1523delCTT\")) transcribedTo r(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"r.1653_1655delcuu\")) r(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"r.1653_1655delcuu\")) translatedTo p(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"p.Phe508del\")) Or using RefSeq: g(refseq:\"NM_000492.3\", var(\"c.1521_1523delCTT\")) transcribedTo r(refseq:\"NM_000492.3\", var(\"r.1653_1655delcuu\")) r(refseq:\"NM_000492.3\", var(\"r.1653_1655delcuu\")) translatedTo p(refseq:\"NP_000483.3\", var(\"p.Phe508del\")) Because a specific position is referenced, a namespace value for a non-ambiguous sequence like the RefSeq ID in the lower example is preferred over the HGNC gene symbol. The r. within the var(\"\") expression indicates that the numbering is based on an RNA reference sequence. The RNA reference sequence covers the entire transcript except for the poly A-tail; numbering starts at the transcription initiation site and ends at the transcription termination site. Recommended Nomenclatures \u00b6 The following nomenclatures are recommended for RNAs: prefix name species ensembl Ensembl all rnacentral RNA Central all Nt Recommended Nomenclatures \u00b6 prefix reason snornabase not maintained Micro-RNAs \u00b6 Micro-RNAs (or, miRNAs) are functional RNAs that regulate gene expression. Unlike other non-protein coding RNAs (e.g. lncRNAs, sRNAs, etc.), miRNAs have their own function in BEL. It works exactly the same way as the r() function. # long form microRNAAbundance(mirbase:MI0000139 ! mmu-mir-1a-1) # short form m(mirbase:MI0000139 ! mmu-mir-1a-1) Like in the previous two examples, it can be shown from which gene an miRNA is transcribed like: g(mgi:2676869 ! Mir1a-1) transcribedTo m(mirbase:MI0000139 ! mmu-mir-1a-1) miRNAs have the unique quality that they have a pre-mature and a mature variant. BEL doesn't have an ontological relationship for this yet, but it's very important to know the related 3' and 5' processed mature miRNAs, which are conveniently listed in miRBase. m(mirbase:MI0000139 ! mmu-mir-1a-1) -- m(mirbase.mature:MIMAT0016979 ! mmu-miR-1a-1-5p) m(mirbase:MI0000139 ! mmu-mir-1a-1) -- m(mirbase.mature:MIMAT0000123 ! mmu-miR-1a-3p) Recommended Nomenclatures \u00b6 The following nomenclatures are recommended for miRNAs: prefix species ensembl all rnacentral all mirbase all mirbase.mature all Proteins \u00b6 proteinAbundance(ns:v) or p(ns:v) denotes the abundance of the protein designated by the value +v+ in the namespace +ns+, where +v+ references a gene or a named protein family. p(hgnc:391 ! AKT1) Protein Variants \u00b6 The variant(\"<expression>\") or var(\"<expression>\") function can be used as an argument within a geneAbundance() , rnaAbundance() , microRNAAbundance() , or proteinAbundance() to indicate a sequence variant of the specified abundance. The var(\"\") function takes HGVS variant description expression, e.g., for a substitution, insertion, or deletion variant. Multiple var(\"\") arguments may be applied to an abundance term. The following BEL functions are special functions that can be used only as an argument within an abundance function. These functions modify the abundance to specify sequence variations (gene, RNA, microRNA, protein), post-translational modifications (protein), fragment resulting from proteolytic processing (protein), or cellular location (most abundance types). As a follow up to the previous examples showing the gene-level and RNA-level modificaitons that lead to the \u0394F508 variant of CFTR, the following is how to express it using the var() function inside a protein with HGVS nomenclature: p(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"p.Phe508del\")) And mor specifically with RefSeq: p(refseq:\"NP_000483.3\", var(\"p.Phe508del\")) CFTR \u0394F508 variant (HGVS NP_000483.3:p.Phe508del ). Because a specific position is referenced, a namespace value for a non-ambiguous sequence like the RefSeq ID in the lower example is preferred over the HGNC gene symbol. The p. within the var(\"\") expression indicates that the numbering is based on a protein reference sequence. Example - Protein reference allele p(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"=\")) This is different than p(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR) , the root protein abundance, which includes all variants. Example - Protein unspecified variant p(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"?\")) Example - Protein substitution 1 p(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"p.Gly576Ala\")) CFTR substitution variant Glycine 576 Alanine (HGVS NP_000483.3:p.Gly576Ala ). Because a specific position is referenced, a namespace value for a non-ambiguous sequence like the RefSeq ID in the lower example is preferred over the HGNC gene symbol. The p. within the var(\"\") expression indicates that the numbering is based on a protein sequence. p(refseq:\"NP_000483.3\", var(\"p.Gly576Ala\")) Example - Protein Substitution 2 This term represents the abundance of the human PIK3CA protein in which the glutamic acid residue at position 545 has been substituted with a lysine. # long form p(HGNC:PIK3CA, variant(\"p.Glu545Lys\")) # short form p(HGNC:PIK3CA, var(\"p.Glu545Lys\")) Example - Protein frameshift p(hgnc:1884 ! CFTR, var(\"p.Thr1220Lysfs\")) CFTR frameshift variant ( HGVS NP_000483.3:p.Thr1220Lysfs*7). Because a specific position is referenced, a namespace value for a non-ambiguous sequence RefSeq ID in the lower example is preferred over the HGNC gene symbol. The p. within the var(\"\") expression indicates that the numbering is based on a protein reference sequence. p(refseq:\"NP_000483.3\", var(\"p.Thr1220Lysfs\")) Example - Protein Truncation The abundances of proteins that are truncated by the introduction of a stop codon can be specified by using the variant(\"\") or var(\"\") function within a protein abundance term. # long form p(HGNC:ABCA1, variant(\"p.Arg1851*\")) # short form p(HGNC:ABCA1, var(\"p.Arg1851*\")) Protein Fragments \u00b6 The fragment() or frag() function can be used within a proteinAbundance() term to specify a protein fragment, e.g., a product of proteolytic cleavage. Protein fragment expressions take the general form: p(ns:v, frag(, )) where <range> (required) is an amino acid range, and <descriptor> (optional) is any additional distinguishing information like fragment size or name. For these examples, HGNC:YFG is \u2018your favorite gene\u2019. For the first four examples, only the <range> argument is used. The last examples include use of the optional <descriptor> . # fragment with known start/stop p(HGNC:YFG, frag(\"5_20\")) # amino-terminal fragment of unknown length p(HGNC:YFG, frag(\"1_?\")) # carboxyl-terminal fragment of unknown length p(HGNC:YFG, frag(\"?_*\")) # fragment with unknown start/stop p(HGNC:YFG, frag(\"?\")) # fragment with unknown start/stop and a descriptor p(HGNC:YFG, frag(\"?\", \"55kD\")) Protein Modifications \u00b6 The proteinModification() / pmod() function can be inside the p() function to indicate modification of the specified protein. Multiple modifications can be applied to the same protein abundance. For example, the phosphorylated Tau protein would look like this: # long form p(uniprot:P10636, proteinModification(Phosphorylation)) # short form p(uniprot:P10636, pmod(Ph)) The first argument of pmod() is the protein modification type. The default BEL namespace includes commonly used protein modification types from the following table: Label Synonym Ac acetylation ADPRib ADP-ribosylation, ADP-rybosylation, adenosine diphosphoribosyl Farn farnesylation Gerger geranylgeranylation Glyco glycosylation Hy hydroxylation ISG ISGylation, ISG15-protein conjugation Me methylation Me1 monomethylation, mono-methylation Me2 dimethylation, di-methylation Me3 trimethylation, tri-methylation Myr myristoylation Nedd neddylation NGlyco N-linked glycosylation NO Nitrosylation OGlyco O-linked glycosylation Palm palmitoylation Ph phosphorylation Sulf sulfation, sulphation, sulfur addition, sulphur addition, sulfonation, sulphonation Sumo SUMOylation Ub ubiquitination, ubiquitinylation, ubiquitylation UbK48 Lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination UbK63 Lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination UbMono monoubiquitination UbPoly polyubiquitination However, any identifier with the form prefix:identifier [! name] can be used. Optionally, the amino acid residue which is modified can be specified with its three letter code: p(uniprot:P10636, pmod(Ph, Ser)) The following amino acids are supported in BEL: Amino Acid 1-Letter Code 3-Letter Code Alanine A Ala Arginine R Arg Asparagine N Asn Aspartic Acid D Asp Cysteine C Cys Glutamic Acid E Glu Glutamine Q Gln Glycine G Gly Histidine H His Isoleucine I Ile Leucine L Leu Lysine K Lys Methionine M Met Phenylalanine F Phe Proline P Pro Serine S Ser Threonine T Thr Tryptophan W Trp Tyrosine Y Tyr Valine V Val Optionally, the position which is modified can be specified p(uniprot:P10636, pmod(Ph, Ser, 519)) More information about this phosphorylation can be found on PhosphoSitePlus . Modified protein abundance term expressions have the general form: p(prefix:identifier [! name], pmod(prefix:identifier [! name], <code>, <pos>)) Example - AKT1 phosphorylated at Serine 473 Default BEL namespace and 3-letter amino acid code: p(hgnc:391 ! AKT1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 473)) PSI-MOD namespace and 3-letter amino acid code: p(hgnc:391 !

MAPK1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 185), pmod(Ph, Tyr, 187)) Example - Palmitoylated HRAS HRAS palmitoylated at an unspecified residue. Default BEL namespace: p(hgnc:5173 ! HRAS, pmod(Palm)) Example - Hydroxylation This term represents the abundance of human HIF1A protein hydroxylated at asparagine 803. # long form p(hgnc:4910 ! HIF1A, proteinModification(Hy, Asn, 803)) # short form p(hgnc:4910 ! HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Asn, 803)) Example - Phosphorylation This term represents the phosphorylation of the human AKT protein family at an unspecified amino acid residue. p(fplx:AKT, pmod(Ph)) Example - Acetylation This term represents the abundance of mouse RELA protein acetylated at lysine 315. p(mgi:103290 ! Rela, pmod(Ac, Lys, 315)) Example - Glycosylation This term represents the abundance of human SP1 protein glycosylated at an unspecified amino acid residue. p(hgnc:11205 ! SP1, pmod(Glyco)) Example - Methylation This term represents the abundance of rat STAT1 protein methylated at an unspecified arginine residue: p(rgd:3771 ! STAT1, pmod(Me, Arg)) Ubiquitination This term represents the abundance of human MYC protein ubiquitinated at an unspecified lysine residue: p(hgnc:7553 ! MYC, pmod(Ub, Lys)) Recommended Nomenclatures \u00b6 Protein Families \u00b6 Families of proteins can be expressed using the p() function as well. For example, the Protein Kinase B (a.k.a., AKT family) can be expressed using any of these several namespaces: p(fplx:AKT) # see: https://signor.uniroma2.it/relation_result.php?id=SIGNOR-PF24&organism=human p(signor:SIGNOR-PF24 ! AKT) # see: https://identifiers.org/ncit:C41625 # NCIT not recommended because they do not provide mappings p(ncit:C41625 ! \"Protein Kinase B\") # The selventa namespace is not maintained. Please do not use. p(sfam:F0014 ! \"AKT Family\") While many resources (such as Bio2BEL repositories) can be used to enrich BEL graphs with protein family's members, they can be encoded directly with the isA relationship as in: p(hgnc:391 ! AKT1) isA p(fplx:AKT) p(hgnc:392 ! AKT2) isA p(fplx:AKT) p(hgnc:393 ! AKT3) isA p(fplx:AKT) Warning: some nomenclatures, such as InterPro, are not organism specific. This results in protein families that contain proteins that are orthologs. Protein families may share a position that is post-translationally modified or a variant. Both the pmod() and var() functions are allowed for protein families, but use with care. For example, the entire AKT family shares the Ser473 phosphorylation. p(fplx:AKT, pmod(Ph, Ser, 473)) Recommended Nomenclatures \u00b6 prefix name fplx FamPlex interpro InterPro signor SIGNOR pro Protein Ontology Not Recommended Nomenclatures \u00b6 prefix reason ncit no mappings available to other resources mesh no mappings available to other resources sfam Selventa families are not maintained. Please upgrade to FamPlex (fplx) A community maintained list of equivalences between protein families is maintained at https://github.com/sorgerlab/famplex/blob/master/equivalences.csv . This is a useful tool for moving away from deprecated namespaces. Protein Domains \u00b6 Protein domains and functional are considered similarly to protein families in BEL because it's useful to think of groups of proteins with the same domain having the same (putative) molecular function (think GO annotations). The Zinc finger, AN1-type can be expressed using the p() tag as in: # See also: https://identifiers.org/interpro:IPR000058 p(interpro:IPR000058 ! \"Zinc finger, AN1-type\") The fact that the AN1-type zinc finger protein 2B has the Zinc finger, AN1-type domain can be encoded with the following: p(uniprot:B4DEN4 ! \"AN1-type zinc finger protein 2B\") isA p(interpro:IPR000058 ! \"Zinc finger, AN1-type\") In general, these kinds of relationships can be automatically extracted from InterPro and shouldn't be manually curated. Recommended Nomenclatures \u00b6 prefix name prosite ProSite interpro InterPro Populations \u00b6 The populationAbundance() / pop() function allow for capturing Taxon and Cell population level changes due to environment or treatments. For example, a population of Streptococcus entericus can be encoded as: # long form populationAbundance(taxonomy:1123302 ! \"Streptococcus entericus DSM 14446\") # short form pop(taxonomy:1123302 ! \"Streptococcus entericus DSM 14446\") Similarly, a population of white adipocytes can be encoded as: pop(mesh:D052436 ! \"Adipocytes, White\") Unlike the gene, RNA, and protein, there are no var() or modification functions for pop() . This function was added in BEL 2.1. The following are example use cases: # Penicillin decreases the population of Streptococcus entericus a(chebi:17334 ! penicillin) decreases pop(taxonomy:1123302 ! \"Streptococcus entericus DSM 14446\") # Firmicutes bacteria increases obesity pop(taxonomy:1239 !

The complexAbundance() function does not specify the duration or stability of the interaction of the members of the complex. The abundances of molecular complexes are represented using the complexAbundance() function. This function can take either a list of abundance terms or a value from a namespace of molecular complexes as its argument. Both BEL Terms represent the IkappaB kinase complex.
