# Associative Relationships

## Association

For terms A and B, `A association B` or `A -- B` indicates that A and B are
associated in an unspecified manner. This relationship is used when not enough
information about the association is available to describe it using more
specific relationships, like `increases` or `positiveCorrelation`. The order of
the subject and object does not affect the interpretation of the statement,
thus `B -- A` is equivalent to `A -- B`.

A common example of association relationships is from literature co-occurrence,
such as genes being annotated to diseases.
