The Biological Expression Language (BEL) facilitates representing scientific findings in
the life sciences in a computable form. It captures causal, correlative, and associative
relationships between biological entities along with the experimental/biological context in which
they were observed as well as the provenance of the publication from which the relation was
reported.

The this website is a community-driven portal whose purpose
is to provide information for new users who want to learn BEL and link to the surrounding
ecosystem of software tools. This page is generated from [GitHub](https://github.com/biological-expression-language/biological-expression-language.github.io/blob/master/README.md)
so changes can either be requested through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/biological-expression-language/biological-expression-language.github.io/issues)
or as a pull request to the repository.

## Specification and Tutorial

The current version (2.0+) specification and tutorial is available [here](https://cthoyt.gitbook.io/bel/).
Previous versions can be found on Selventa's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/OpenBEL/language).

The <a href="https://bel.bio/">BEL.bio</a> project hosts additional programatically generated
[language documentation](https://language.bel.bio) as well as sporadically updated structured
[EBNF specifications](https://github.com/belbio/bel_specifications/tree/master/specifications) of
each version of BEL.

## Language Evolution and History

Changes and improvements are submitted as BEL Enhancement Proposals (BEPs) then
reviewed by the [BEL Language Committee](https://github.com/belbio/bep/blob/master/CommitteeGuidelines.md).
A listing of all BEPs can be found [here](http://bep.bel.bio/). A tutorial on how
to submit a BEP can be found [here](https://github.com/belbio/bep).

  was published in June 2014.

BEL was created by Dexter Pratt while at Selventa, but has since become an entirely-community driven
project. A more detailed history can be found in this [blog post](https://cthoyt.com/2020/04/28/history-of-bel.html).

## Community

The BEL community primarily uses [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openbel-discuss)
for discussions, troubleshooting, and community organization. Additional
discussion may also be found in the [BEL.bio project forum](https://forum.bel.bio).

There are several openly available sources of BEL Content hosted by different organizations.
Selventa originally published two large example BEL documents that serve as a good starting point -
the [Selventa Small Corpus](https://github.com/cthoyt/selventa-knowledge/blob/master/selventa_knowledge/small_corpus.bel)
and the [Selventa Large Corpus](https://github.com/cthoyt/selventa-knowledge/blob/master/selventa_knowledge/large_corpus.bel).
A summary of other publicly accessible BEL content can be found in this [blog post](https://cthoyt.com/2020/04/30/public-bel-content.html).

## Citation

While BEL was created by Dexter Pratt at Selventa in the early 2000's, the most recent reference
publication for the language itself is:

[**Recent advances in modeling languages for pathway maps and computable biological networks**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2013.12.011).
<br /> Slater, T. (2014).
